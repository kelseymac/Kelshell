# Kelshell


I created a basic Linux shell in C for my Operating Systems class. You are able to navigate the available file systems, execute commands, pass a variable number of arguments to those commands, and redirect standard input and standard output for those programs.

If you type "debugargs" as your command then other arguments. It will display each argument.
